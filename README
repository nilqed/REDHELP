A portable general-purpose computer algebra system

REDUCE is a system for doing scalar, vector and matrix algebra by computer, 
which also supports arbitrary precision numerical approximation and interfaces 
to gnuplot to provide graphics. It can be used interactively for simple 
calculations (as illustrated in the screenshot below) but also provides a 
full programming language, with a syntax similar to other modern programming 
languages. REDUCE supports alternative user interfaces including Emacs and 
TeXmacs.
